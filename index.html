   <div>
   <p>Hello all! We are the Brennan's and we love smokey, nutty dark/medium blends of coffee and espresso. We love being a small business and as hands on in our process as possible. From selecting the coffee beans, fire roasting every bag and dropping them off at our cafes - we truly love what we do and the smiling faces that confirm what we know, Brennan's Beans is a delicious cup of bean water!<p></div>
<div>
<p>We grew up in a large city with Starbucks on every corner. It seemed the only option for our beloved morning drink. As teenagers, coffee was coffee. If it had caffiene - it did the job. As adults, the search for dark roasted beans with an intact flavor profile became more and more important. We started sampling beans from every local cafe we could find. It quickly became our weekend passion! 
   </p></div>
<div>
<p>Coffee has been our passion ever since we can remember. There is nothing better than the smell of freshly roasted beans to wake up the senses each morning. We believe that every bag should be top quality and set the highest bar for flavor profiles.

    <h2>What We Do & Why</h2>
      </header>
    <section class="second-para">
      <div>
 <p>What do we do? Honestly, we drink coffee. Almost always, we can be found with a cup of wonderful coffee. It bodes well for us that our passion has become our career. We do what we love. We roast all of our beans over an open fire. There is nothing better than chocolatey, caramel based espresso profiles.</p></div>
        <div>
<p>Why do we roast our beans over a fire? Because we love the natural process and the flavor profiles that can be attained via traditional methods. Using a fire to roast our bains allows us to pay hommage to the most original roots of this age old honored drink. We aim to get rid of the acidic, bitter taste that can often be found in other form of roasted beans.</div></p>

      <h3>Community Impact</h3>
    </header>
    <section class="third-para">
      <p>We want to give back to our community as much and more than it has given us. We donate one bag of coffee to a local charity for every five bags bought. We select causes and organizations every month. Do you know of any that you are passionate about? We would love to hear your recommendations! Please feel free to reach out via our email, which can be found under <em>Get in Touch</em> at the top of the page.</p>
