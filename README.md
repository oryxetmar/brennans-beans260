3. Reflection:
- i spent at least 3-4 hours trying to figure out how to centre align text. i am not kidding. i was very shaky with flexbox and i wasnt understanding the process very well. around 7:30pm yesterday i made a discovery!! 
- display: flex;  - this is necessary IT IS V NECESSARY
- i used the dev tools to correct bugs and that was so helpful as well, just to understand what was preventing movements or additions when i felt confused about what wasnt working like i wanted it to
## Further Reflections
- so i had a lot to learn in regards to linking the css.styles and stylesheets
- its taken me about 3 hours honestly to try and figure out what ive done wrong. BUT GOOD NEWS; it looks like a simple issue of not having enough code added into the html:5 head
- as well as I had a /css.style and that needed to be correcting in the link line to appropriate name for my link which was css.style ... awesome lol
- i am getting very good at solving my issues on my own but i am NOT FAST AT IT HOLY HECK
 ## current issue
 - i cannot quite understand why my coffee mug logo with the hover effect wont appear on my github page but my fontawesome link is attached properly i believe (altho obvi not)
